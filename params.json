Each read in a Fastq file consists of four rows: the identifier, the sequence, a separator, and the base qualities.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n@HWI-ST863:222:D22L1ACXX:8:1101:1095:55853/1\r\nATTGCATGCACACCAAGTGTTNGGCAAAATGTTAGAGTGAGACGACAGTTGGGGAGGTTTGACGATTATCTTTCATTTGTAGAGTAGATGAATCGAAGA\r\n+\r\n@@@DDDDDHHHHFD;AG:CBF#3AFGHIEBGEHGG?F1?CBBDHGGFF8BFHID;;B(=?B>CBCC=C@CCCCC@>CDC>@A@:@CCCDCACDCBBC<5\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nWe want to:\r\n\r\n*   load that data into memory,\r\n*   perform some quality control tests, and\r\n*   plot the results.\r\n\r\nTo do all that, we'll have to learn a little bit about programming.\r\n\r\n> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}\r\n>\r\n> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories\r\n> (including the working directory) and how to start a Python\r\n> interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson references the Jupyter (IPython)\r\n> Notebook although it can be taught through any Python interpreter.\r\n> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 2**.\r\n\r\n> ## Getting ready {.getready}\r\n>\r\n> You need to download some files to follow this lesson:\r\n>\r\n> 1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `python-novice-fastqc`.\r\n> 2. Download [python-novice-fastqc-data.zip](./python-novice-fastqc-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.\r\n> 3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called `data`.\r\n> 4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:\r\n>\r\n> ~~~ {.input}\r\n> $ cd && cd Desktop/python-novice-fastqc/data\r\n> ~~~\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n\r\n1.
